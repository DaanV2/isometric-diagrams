# Claude Code Guide — isometric-diagrams

## What this project is

A Svelte 5 / SvelteKit web app that renders YAML diagram specs as interactive
isometric 3-D SVG diagrams. Users write YAML; the app projects it through an
isometric coordinate system and paints it as SVG. There is also a standalone
CLI tool (`cli/`) for importing cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Terraform,
Kubernetes) into the YAML format.

## Renderer layer architecture

The rendering code has three distinct layers. **Keep them separate.**

```
src/lib/renderer/isometric.ts   ← pure projection math (no diagram types)
src/lib/renderer/shapes.ts      ← drawing primitives (diagram types → SVG geometry)
src/lib/renderer/theme.ts       ← colours and theme constants
src/lib/components/Isometric*.svelte  ← Svelte components (display only)
```

### `isometric.ts` — projection math only

Low-level functions that convert grid coordinates to screen coordinates.
**No diagram types here.** Takes raw numbers, returns numbers or SVG path strings.

Key functions: `isoToScreen`, `screenToIso` (inverse, for drag-to-place),
`boxPaths`, `ribbonPath`, `polylinePath`, `ribbonArrowHead`, `insetRouteEnds`,
`floorTilePath`, `tilePath`, `boundingBox`.

Coordinate system:
- Grid X-axis → right-and-down on screen
- Grid Y-axis → left-and-down on screen
- Grid Z-axis → straight up (height)
- `screenX = (gx - gy) * tileSize`, `screenY = (gx + gy) * (tileSize/2) - gz * tileSize`

### `shapes.ts` — drawing primitives (the "what to draw" layer)

**This is the layer components should import from.** Each function takes a typed
diagram object + `tileSize` and returns SVG-ready geometry (path strings, polygon
point strings, `ScreenPoint` anchors).

| Function | Returns | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `nodeBox(node, tileSize)` | `NodeBox` — face paths + label/icon positions | `IsometricNode` |
| `edgeGeometry(from, to, directed, hasLabel, tileSize)` | `EdgeGeometry` — ribbon band path + gloss spine + arrowhead + midpoint | `IsometricEdge` |
| `flatArrowGeometry(arrow, tileSize)` | `FlatArrowGeometry` — ribbon band path + gloss spine + arrowhead + midpoint | `IsometricFlatArrow` |
| `floorTileGeometry(tile, tileSize)` | `FloorTileGeometry` — outline path + label position | `IsometricFloorTile` |
| `groupBoundary(members, tileSize, gpad?)` | `GroupBoundary` — isometric parallelogram points + label anchor | `IsometricDiagram` |
| `isoGridLines(nodes, tileSize)` | `string[]` — one SVG path per grid line | `IsometricDiagram` |

`NODE_HEIGHT = 1` is the shared constant for how tall node boxes are in grid
units. Use it instead of hard-coding `1`.

### Svelte components — display only

Components import from `shapes.ts`, compute one `$derived` geometry value, and
bind its named fields into the SVG template. They should contain **no raw
`isoToScreen` / `boxPaths` calls** — if you need a new shape, add it to
`shapes.ts` first.

## Diagram viewport (pan / zoom / export)

`IsometricDiagram` renders a `position:relative` viewport `<div>` that fills its
parent, an `<svg width=100% height=100%>` whose `viewBox` is driven by a
pan/zoom view, and fixed HTML overlays (title, zoom controls, export buttons,
node-info) that do **not** pan/zoom.

- The `viewBox` is kept at the viewport's aspect ratio (`vpW/zoom × vpH/zoom`)
  so screen↔world mapping is linear; this makes wheel-zoom-around-cursor exact.
- `userZoom` / `userCenter` are `null` until the user interacts — the view then
  follows the auto-fit (`fitZoom`/`fitCenter`) derived from the content `bbox`.
  The ⊡ Fit button resets them to `null`.
- Pan starts only when the pointerdown target is not inside a `.iso-node`, so
  node clicks still select.
- Export lives in `src/lib/export.ts` (`downloadSvg` / `downloadPng`). It clones
  the live `<svg>`, inlines each element's **computed** style (scoped component
  CSS and CSS vars don't survive serialization), frames it to the content
  bounds, and paints a background.
- Sharing/persistence: the page persists the doc to `localStorage` and encodes
  permalinks via `src/lib/share.ts` (`encodeShare`/`decodeShare`, base64url).
  Restore order on load: `#d=…` permalink → last session → default example.

### Direct manipulation & layout

- **Drag-to-place**: pass `onnodemove(id, {x, y})` to `IsometricDiagram`.
  Pointer-down on a node starts a candidate drag; capture is taken lazily on the
  first real move (so plain clicks never go through capture and the node's own
  click stays the selection path). The grab point maps screen→grid via
  `screenToIso`, snapping to integers. A trailing click after a real drag is
  swallowed by a capture-phase guard so selection isn't toggled off.
- **Auto-layout**: `autoLayout(spec)` in `src/lib/layout.ts` is a layered
  (longest-path) placement — ranks become rows, siblings are centred, z is
  preserved. The page's ⤢ Layout button applies it and re-dumps the YAML.
- Visual edits (drag, UI editor, auto-layout) update `spec` live and re-dump
  `editorYaml` on a short debounce (`syncYamlFromSpec`). Re-dumping drops YAML
  comments — that's the accepted trade-off for visual editing.

## Svelte 5 reactivity rules

- Use `$derived.by(() => { ... })` for computed values whose logic is more than
  a single expression. **Never use `$derived(() => { ... })`** — that stores the
  function itself as the derived value and tracks zero reactive dependencies,
  breaking live updates.
- Use `$derived(expr)` only for simple single-expression derivations.
- Prefer one named `geo` / `box` derived per component over multiple fine-grained
  derived values that call the same function with slightly different args.

## Node rendering

Every node renders as a 1-tile-tall **solid** isometric box (`NODE_HEIGHT = 1`).
The box has three faces: `top` (diamond), `left` (parallelogram), `right`
(parallelogram). Face colours come from `getNodeColours(node.type)` in
`theme.ts`, which derives all three faces from a single base hue so every cube
is lit consistently (top brightest → right mid-tone → left in shadow). Faces get
a vertical depth gradient (`#iso-face-shade`) and the top a glossy sheen
(`#iso-top-sheen`); a soft contact shadow (`#iso-soft-shadow`, defined in the
diagram `<defs>`) grounds each cube. The type icon rests on the top face on a
subtle plate.

`IsometricNode` takes a `part` prop: `'body'` (cube + icon), `'label'` (text
only), or `'all'`. The diagram renders all node **bodies** first, then a second
**label** pass (`part="label"`, plus group labels) so labels always paint on top
of every cube and never hide behind a neighbour. Only `part !== 'label'` groups
carry the `.iso-node` class / interaction handlers.

Painter's algorithm: nodes are sorted by `x + y` before rendering so closer
nodes paint over farther ones.

## Group boundaries

Groups render as a flat isometric "zone rug" on the **ground plane** (SVG
`<polygon>`), **not** axis-aligned rectangles. All four corners are projected at
`z = 0` so opposite edges are parallel and lie on the isometric grid lines — a
true parallelogram the member cubes stand on, rather than a skewed quad (an
earlier version mixed cube-top and ground corners, which made the edges look
diagonal). Each corner is pushed out half a tile so the zone encloses the corner
tiles' footprints. The polygon is painted behind everything; the group label is
drawn in the label overlay pass so it stays legible. Computed via
`groupBoundary()` in `shapes.ts`.

## Edge & arrow ribbons

Edges and flat arrows render as flat **ribbons lying on the ground plane**, not
thin floating strokes. A ribbon is a filled band built by offsetting the route
**in grid (ground) space** by `RIBBON_HALF_WIDTH` grid units on each side, then
projecting — so the band foreshortens like real tape on the floor instead of
keeping a constant screen width. Built by `ribbonPath()` in `isometric.ts`
(mitred joins keep corners crisp). A thin white "gloss spine" (`polylinePath()`
down the centreline) sells the flat-strip look; the arrowhead is a flat,
ground-plane barbed chevron shaped in grid space (`ribbonArrowHead()`).

- **Edge route**: an L-shaped two-segment path `(fromX,fromY)` → `(toX,fromY)` →
  `(toX,toY)`, laid flat at `z = (fromZ+toZ)/2`. The arrowhead points along the
  **last segment** (the Y-direction leg arriving at the destination).
- **Ends are inset** out of the cube footprints via `insetRouteEnds()` (grid
  units) so a directed arrowhead lands just outside the destination cube's near
  face instead of being buried under the box. Edges paint *below* the node
  bodies (painter's order), so the ribbon passes behind cubes and the arrowhead
  tucks into the near face.
- Ribbons fade in on mount (group `opacity` keyframe); dependency edges keep
  their dashed read via a dashed gloss spine.

## Authoring diagnostics

`parseYaml` only guarantees structural well-formedness (and throws a `ParseError`
carrying a 1-based `line` for YAML syntax errors). Semantic problems that would
otherwise fail silently — edges/groups referencing unknown node ids, duplicate
ids, unknown enum values, self-loops, empty diagrams — are reported as
**non-fatal** `Diagnostic`s by `lintSpec(spec)` in `src/lib/parser/lint.ts`.
The editor shows them in a "Problems" panel; each diagnostic carries a `ref`
token the page locates via `findTokenLine` to jump the textarea to the source.
Valid type names come from `NODE_TYPE_NAMES` / `EDGE_TYPE_NAMES` in `theme.ts`
(runtime source of truth, mirroring the unions).

The UI editor and canvas share selection: `IsometricDiagram` and `UiEditor`
both take an optional controlled `selectedId` + `onselect`, lifted to the page.

## Known open issues

See the GitHub issue tracker. The earlier rendering items (#25 hardcoded
`stroke-dasharray`, #27 hardcoded node description offset, #28 edge depth
sorting) are all resolved. The performance/usability plan is largely delivered:
in-place reactive updates + debounced parse, pan/zoom + fit, SVG/PNG export,
localStorage/permalink persistence, authoring diagnostics, drag-to-place, and
in-app auto-layout. Remaining follow-ups: a full code editor (CodeMirror with
syntax highlight/autocomplete) and extending the visual UI editor to manage
groups, flat arrows, floor tiles, z-height, styles, and meta.

## Unit testing

The renderer modules have a Vitest unit test suite. Run it with:

```
npm run test:unit          # single run
npm run test:unit:watch    # watch mode
```

### Testing conventions

- **One file per functional domain**, named `<module>-<domain>.test.ts`.
- **Shared test helpers live in `helpers.ts`** — import `TILE`, `cfg`, `makeNode`, `makeEdge`, `makeArrow`, `makeTile`, and `pathNumbers` from there rather than redefining them per file.
- **Test what the function guarantees**, not its internal implementation: path structure (`M…L…Z`), vertex counts, exact SVG strings for key cases, and behavioural properties (scaling, elevation, default values).
- **Add a new `__tests__/` file** whenever you add a new exported function to `isometric.ts` or `shapes.ts`. Follow the existing naming pattern.
- Vitest is configured in `vite.config.ts` with `include: ['src/**/*.test.ts']`; files under `__tests__/` are picked up automatically.

## Branch conventions

- Active feature/fix work: `fix/<description>` or `feat/<description>`
- Do not push directly to `main`; open a PR from the feature branch

## Public API (`src/lib/index.ts`)

Re-exports the parser, core isometric math functions, theme helpers, and all
TypeScript types. When adding new exported functions to `isometric.ts` or
`shapes.ts` that callers outside the app might need, add them to `index.ts`.
